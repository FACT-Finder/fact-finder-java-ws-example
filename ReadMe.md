# FACT-Finder webservice example (Java)

This project should show how to send requests to the different FACT-Finder APIs. 
You'll find the examples inside the `Runner*`-classes, which are executable on their own. 
To let them run, you first need to adjust the `Settings`-class according to your FACT-Finder environment.
